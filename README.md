### Developing

* open in your favorite editor
* in your terminal / command line, enter: ```serve```
* to compile the .scss file once, and from the css folder enter this in terminal:
```node-sass style.scss style.css```
* to 'watch' and have it auto-compile while developing, the command is ```node-sass style.scss style.css -w```
* Chrome will be listening on port 3000, so the development url is: ```localhost:3000```
